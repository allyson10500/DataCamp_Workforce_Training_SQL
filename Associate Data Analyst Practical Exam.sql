--Task 1 Last year (2022) there was a bug in the product system. For some products that were added in that year, the year_added value was not set in the data. As the year the product was added may have an impact on the price of the product, this is important information to have.

--Write a query to determine how many products have the year_added value missing. Your output should be a single column, missing_year, with a single row giving the number of missing values.

--Select distinct

SELECT year_added
FROM products
WHERE year_added IS NULL

/*
    Task 2
Given what you know about the year added data, you need to make sure all of the data is clean before you start your analysis. The table below shows what the data should look like.

Write a query to ensure the product data matches the description provided. Do not update the original table.

*/ 
SELECT product_id, 
	product_type,
	CASE WHEN brand = '-' THEN 'Unknown' ELSE brand END AS brand,
	TO_CHAR(CAST(REGEXP_REPLACE(weight, '[^\d.]', '', 'g') AS NUMERIC), 'FM999999990.00') AS weight,
	ROUND(price::NUMERIC, 2) AS price,
	average_units_sold,
	CASE WHEN year_added IS NULL THEN 2022 ELSE year_added END AS year_added,
	INITCAP(stock_location) as stock_location
FROM products

/*
Task 3
To find out how the range varies for each product type, your manager has asked you to determine the minimum and maximum values for each product type.

Write a query to return the product_type, min_price and max_price columns.

*/

SELECT 
    product_type, 
    MIN(price) AS min_price, 
    MAX(price) AS max_price
FROM products
GROUP BY product_type;

*/
Task 4
The team want to look in more detail at meat and dairy products where the average units sold was greater than ten.
*/
--Write a query to return the product_id, price and average_units_sold of the rows of interest to the team.

-- Write your query for task 4 in this cell

SELECT 
    product_id, 
    price, 
    average_units_sold
FROM products
WHERE (product_type = 'Meat' OR product_type = 'Dairy')
      AND average_units_sold > 10;
